Data, like our experiences, is always evolving and accumulating. To keep up, our mental models of the world must adapt to new data, some of which contains new dimensions – new ways of seeing things we had no conception of before. These mental models are not unlike a table’s schema, defining how we categorize and process new information.

This brings us to schema management. As business problems and requirements evolve over time, so too does the structure of your data. With Delta Lake, as the data changes, incorporating new dimensions is easy. Users have access to simple semantics to control the schema of their tables. These tools include schema enforcement, which prevents users from accidentally polluting their tables with mistakes or garbage data, as well as schema evolution, which enables them to automatically add new columns of rich data when those columns belong. In this webinar, we’ll dive into the use of these tools. In this webinar you will learn about:

* Understanding table schemas and schema enforcement
* How does schema enforcement work?
* How is schema enforcement useful?
* Preventing data dilution
* How does schema evolution work?
* How is schema evolution useful?
